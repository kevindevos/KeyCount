## Key features
1. Count daily keystrokes and mouse clicks and display them in the macOS menu bar
2. Saves keystroke and mouse click data to a local file with path `/Users/<USER>/Library/Containers/com.kevindevos.macos-keystroke-counter/Data/Documents` in json format.

## To run the app:
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/kevindevos/KeyCount/releases#latest)
2. Run the app and grant permissions (see below)

## Granting permissions
This application requires your permission to receive events from macOS in order to count and display your keystrokes in the menu bar.

On newer versions of macOS (10.15+) there is an Input Monitoring menu under Security & Privacy within the System Preferences app, and macos-keystroke-counter will appear there automatically the first time you run it. Simply unlock this menu and check the box next to macos-keystroke-counter to enable it.
